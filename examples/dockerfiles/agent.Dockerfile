# Simple webserver example, this will return a 404 before the keeper is run, and after
# it will display the secret file

# Assumes you are using the default working_dir, /tmp and the managed_files, quotes.txt

# docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8888:8888 -e FLUXVAULT_WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1 -e FLUXVAULT_MANAGED_FILES=quotes.txt --name fluxcomponent1_app1 -it <YOUR IMAGE NAME>




# Depending on your platform, if you're running this in development locally, your keeper address can change.
# Just let it error and update the whitelisted address

# Once the container is running, browse to http://localhost:8080

# Then run the keeper in another console (if you have it installed), or fire up the
# example keeper docker image
