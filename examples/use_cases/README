## Audience

This use case is suited to Fluxers who want a simple way of getting a password or two into a container, and don't care about state.

In fileserver mode, any files that are transferred are set to STRICT mode, meaning, if the file is changed, it will be overwritten again when the Keeper connects. If this doesn't work for you, check out one of the other use cases.

A shim script can be setup on your app components to fetch the files before starting the entrypoint. See example below.

## Usage

### 1/ Create file dir

These are your secret files. Create a dir and add in your secrets. They can be anything. Any file or folder structure is fine here. Plain text or binary / images etc. Just beware - whatever size your file dir is, will end up on your agents.

For example, in your current directory, make a new file dir and add a few files.

```
mkdir secrets && touch secrets/secret_file && echo \
"1844 Samuel FB Morse: What hath God Wrought?
1876 Alexander Graham Bell: Mr. Watson -- come here -- I want to see you.
2022 Dan Keller: Don't be Evil, again" > secrets/quotes.txt
```

### 2/ Create docker network

```
docker network create http
```

### 3/ Get gateway for http network

```
docker network inspect http -f '{{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}'
```

### 4/ Start agent

Note - for the whitelist-addresses, add 2 to the gateway. So if the gatway was 172.18.0.1, we want 172.18.0.3.

You don't strictly need to expose ports, however I was running Keeper natively on macOS.

```
docker run --rm --name fluxagent_demoVault --network http -p 8888:8888 -p 2080:2080 -it megachips/fluxvault:0.8.4 agent --whitelist-addresses 172.18.0.3
```

### 5/ Start Keeper

Note, for testing, we're using a docker image here. You can also run this natively on your computer. (You will need Python 3.10 installed, venv use is recommended)

For the --agent-ips add 1 to the gateway. So for our example, would be 172.18.0.2

You need to volume mount in your fileserver dir that you created earlier. This entire directory will become available on the Agent. We mount it in, then tell the keeper where it is with the --fileserver-dir switch.

For this example, our app name is `turnip` This becomes relevant in later use cases.

```
docker run --rm --name fluxkeeper_demoVault -v $(pwd)/secrets:/data/fileserver --network http -it megachips/fluxvault:0.8.4 keeper run-single-app turnip --fileserver-dir /data/fileserver --agent-ips 172.18.0.2 --polling-interval 20
```

### 6/ Start example App

```
docker run --rm --name fluxapp_demoVault --network http -p 8080:8080 -it megachips/fluxvault-exampleapp:latest
```

### 7/ See the magic

Browse to `http://localhost:8080/file/quotes.txt`

You should see the quote displayed.

### 8/ How does this work?

What happened above? So the keeper transferred the files to the agent. The agent and the app reside in the same private network, so the app queried the agent via it's hostname, then served that up via a simple Python aiohttp webserver.
